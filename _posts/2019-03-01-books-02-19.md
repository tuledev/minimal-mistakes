## 1. React: Cross-Platform Application Development with React Native - by Emilio Rodriguez Martinez

Published in March 2018, this book for developers who want to use React Native. You can learn:

* Structure React Native projects
* Manage state with Redux, MobX
* Some UI components, animations
* Basic firebase realtime database

Something are missing from this books:

* Debugging
* Deploy app to real device
* Firebase security

**Caution: Don't put the API key in clients to push notificaiton**

## 2. Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship-Chapter 1,2,3,4,7 - by Robert C. Martin

**RECOMMEND**

A masterpiece that every developer should know, and read at least once.

I read it once a year. And I really learn new things each time I read it. So many gold things that I can't summary. Just read every line.

## 3. The Catcher in the Rye - by J.D. Salinger

Published in 1951, a classic novel and more classical nowadays.

I read the Vietnameses verison, and I'm reading the English version. I see myself in the hating part of Caulfield. If Caulfield lives in our world these days, he will hate a lot of modern things. "It killed me!" lmao.

## 4. Creativity at Work - by Alan Barker

A random book I got. There're some good points here.
