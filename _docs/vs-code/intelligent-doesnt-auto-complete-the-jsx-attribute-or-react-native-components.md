# Intelligent doesn't auto complete  the JSX attribute or react-native components

## Issue

I got stuck for days in 2 times.   
1. The first time, VSCode doesn't auto-complete/suggest the JSX attribute and react-native components props. The weirdest thing is it just happen in 2/4 my projects. I spent days and gave up. Then after some weeks, the auto-complete works again. I don't why.  
2. The second, VSCode after a lunch break, its intelligent was broken again. After hours, I don't know why also. But fortunately, I found a solution.

## Solution 

Add **@type/react-native** package to devDependencies
